#Task B7.1: Create two lists with the same content, list1 and list2, and a third variable list3 = list1.
#Use the is and is not operators (along with id()) to check and explain which variables refer to the same
#object in memory.
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]
list3 = list1
print(list1 == list2)

print(id(list1), id(list2), id(list3))
